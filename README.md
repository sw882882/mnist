# MNIST 

A repo showing my progress with the well known MNIST dataset as I learn the basics of ML

## Getting the data

For whatever reason you want to replicate the code, clone the data using the kaggle cli into the data/ folder

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c digit-recognizer
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Todo

- [x] Getting it working with ANN
- [ ] Make version with CNN to get higher accuracy
- [ ] Make version pure Numpy for the sake of understanding the low level aspects of ML
